Programmersâ€™ day is celebrated on the 256th day of the year. It usually falls on September 12th. This year on September 12th we (Ilya and Anna) met with our bartender friend Eugeniy at Grizzly bar on Nevsky Prospekt in Saint Petersburg.
Eugeniy has promised to help us with a new version of our project **Cocktails for programmers**. The first version of it you can find [HERE](https://github.com/cocktails-for-programmers/cocktails_for_programmers). Today we offer you to see what we did this time.

### JavaScript

**Ilya:** Eugeniy, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages on the Web, a cocktail for JavaScript developers should be coffee-based.

```

### The BUG

**I:** Eugeniy, a bug is something preventing a program or a computer from working fine. We need a cocktail somehow related to this.

**E:** All right. Especially for this there is a jar with a bug.
