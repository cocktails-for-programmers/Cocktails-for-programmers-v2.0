The programmer's day is celebrated on the 256th day each year. Usually it's the 12th of september. This year on 12th of september we (Ilya and Anna) met our bartender friend Eugeniy at Grizzly bar on Nevsky Prospekt in Saint Petersburg.
Eugeniy promised us help to do new version of our project **Cocktails for programmers**. The first part of this project you can find [HERE](https://github.com/cocktails-for-programmers/cocktails_for_programmers). Today we offer you to see what we did this time.
